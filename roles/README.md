Ansible Roles
====
Roles are ways of automatically loading certain vars\_files, tasks, and handlers based on a known file structure. Grouping content by roles also allows easy sharing of roles with other users.

You can find the official documentation for roles [here](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html).
